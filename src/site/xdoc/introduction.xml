				This is a Maven2 extention that allows writing Annotated Plug-in Mojos using JDK 1.5+ annotations.
				This has a couple of benefits over using JavaDoc-style annotations:
                <ul>
				<li>First, you will get compile-time checks for your plugin metadata.</li>
				<li>Second, you can use annotations on interface getter methods instead of field annotations,
				which allows for greater flexibility in your plugin object model.</li>
				<li>Finally, since JDK 1.5 annotations are supported in most IDEs,
                    you will benefit from code-completion and syntactic checks.</li>
                </ul>

				Enjoy.
